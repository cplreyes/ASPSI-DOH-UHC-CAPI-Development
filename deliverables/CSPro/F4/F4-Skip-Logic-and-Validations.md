# F4 Household Survey — Skip Logic and Validations Spec

> [!warning] SUPERSEDED — the generator is the source of truth (banner added 2026-06-27)
> This spec **trails the UAT-evolved generator** (F4-DOC-01). For current behavior read the inline comments in `deliverables/CSPro/F4/generate_apc.py` / `generate_dcf.py` and the bound `.apc`. Do **not** "re-fix" code to match this doc — the departures below are intentional UAT closures.
> Intentional, undocumented departures: `CONSENT_GIVEN` removed (→ BREAKOFF disposition); single 12-digit PSGC case key; **Q138–Q143 bill-recall asked of everyone** (#699/#701); Q195 is a 6-band % (not 0–100); Q105=No→Q107; Q90=No→Q94. One pending ASPSI ruling: **F4-VAL-01** Q141.1 no-receipt gate (recommend drop the gate; cap check stays).

Source-of-truth for CSPro CAPI logic on `HouseholdSurvey.dcf`. Covers:

1. **Sanity-check findings** — schema gaps and discrepancies between the Apr 20 questionnaire (Q1–Q202, 17 sections) and the current dcf (22 records / 623 items).
2. **Skip-logic table** — every conditional jump extracted from the questionnaire, section by section A–Q.
3. **Cross-field validations** — HARD (block save), SOFT (warn-and-confirm), GATE (display-only conditional rendering).
4. **CSPro logic templates** — paste-ready snippets for Field Control, PSGC cascade, household-roster loop, WHO expenditure grid, financial bill-recall chain, distress financing.
5. **Open questions routing** — dispositioned per F3 convention (genuine ASPSI asks vs spec-decisions).
6. **Implementation order** — recommended build sequence.

All Q-numbers refer to the **Apr 20 printed questionnaire** (1–202); dcf item names follow the `Q{n}_*` convention. This spec mirrors the shape of `deliverables/CSPro/F1/F1-Skip-Logic-and-Validations.md` and `deliverables/CSPro/F3/F3-Skip-Logic-and-Validations.md`.

> **Item-count provenance.** The Apr 20 F4 DCF was 21 records / 611 items capturing 202 numbered source questions. Expansion from source → dcf is driven by the same patterns as F3: payment/consumption matrices explode each row into flag + amount pairs, select-all items get per-option `_O01..On` flag items plus an `_OTHER_TXT` companion, and a separate `FIELD_CONTROL` + `HOUSEHOLD_GEO_ID` pair captures survey logistics and PSGC cascade. The Apr 21 GPS+photo pass added GPS metadata (altitude, accuracy, satellites, read-time, capture trigger) alongside the preserved `LATITUDE`/`LONGITUDE` in `HOUSEHOLD_GEO_ID`, plus a new verification-photo record (`REC_CASE_VERIFICATION`, type Z) — bringing the dcf to **22 records / 623 items**. See `wiki/analyses/Analysis - Apr 20 DCF Generator Audit.md` for the per-chunk rewrite ledger (chunks 1–8, commits `fe3b567` → `001b796`).

## 1. Sanity-check findings (dcf vs Apr 20 questionnaire)

### A. Schema gaps — must be fixed in `generate_dcf.py` before CAPI build

| # | Item | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~`C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER` not repeating~~ **CLOSED-BY-VERIFICATION 2026-04-21.** | Entry was stale against the current generator. `build_section_c()` in `generate_dcf.py:487` already emits `record("C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER", ..., "E", items, max_occurs=20)`, and the committed `HouseholdSurvey.dcf:2836` shows `"occurrences": { "required": true, "maximum": 20 }`. `MEMBER_LINE_NO` is the id-item (zero-filled, length=2). Roster loops correctly. | No code change. Finding #7 below is now actually enforceable. |
| 2 | ~~`J_HEALTH_SEEKING` not per-member~~ **CLOSED-BY-DESIGN 2026-04-21.** | Apr 20 source uses singular "you/your household member" phrasing for Q101–Q107 — intentionally respondent-level, not roster-repeating (downgraded from the Apr 08 `max_occurs=20` structure per Annex G#4). Code comment at `generate_dcf.py:984–989` documents this. `J_HEALTH_SEEKING` correctly emits `"maximum": 1`. Section H (PhilHealth) follows the same respondent-level pattern (`generate_dcf.py:785–789`). | No code change. |
| 3 | **Q47 placement** | `Q47_HH_HAS_PRIVATE_INS` lives in its own `C_HH_PRIVATE_INS_GATE` record between `C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER` and `D_UHC_AWARENESS`. Q47 is the household-level "does anyone in the HH have private insurance" gate — Q49/Q50 per-member insurance lives inside the roster. | Acceptable as-is: isolating the HH-level gate from the per-member loop keeps the roster schema clean. Document the split. |
| 4 | **Q2 birth date ↔ Q2.1 age** | Q2 captures `BIRTH_MONTH` + `BIRTH_YEAR`; Q2.1 captures `AGE`. Source asks "age on last birthday" — needs consistency rule: `AGE` must equal the computed year difference from BIRTH_YEAR given today's date (±1 for pre/post-birthday bracket). | HARD consistency rule in §3.2. |
| 5 | **Q18 amount + bracket duality** | Same pattern as F3 Q18. Q18_INCOME_AMOUNT + Q18_INCOME_BRACKET captured together — needs consistency check (amount falls in bracket). | HARD consistency rule in §3.2. |
| 6 | **Q15 IP_GROUP coded list** | Source says "A list will be provided" but Annex F4 ships free-text only (identical to F3 Q31). | Route to ASPSI (§5, item #1). Keep alpha as default. |
| 7 | **Q19 vs roster count** | `Q19_HH_SIZE_TOTAL` is the self-reported HH size; roster occurrences should equal Q19 (or Q19 − 1 if respondent is listed separately). | HARD post-roster rule (finding #1 already closed): `count(C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER) = Q19_HH_SIZE_TOTAL`. Implement in roster `postproc`. |
| 8 | **Section N per-item "consumed" gate pattern** | 42 expenditure items use the three-column pattern `{Q}_CONSUMED` → `{Q}_PURCHASED_PHP` → `{Q}_INKIND_PHP`. Needs uniform gate: if `_CONSUMED = No`, both `_PURCHASED_PHP` and `_INKIND_PHP` must be 0 or blank. | Spec as HARD gate + PROC template in §4.9. |
| 9 | **Section N subtotals** | Q157, Q177, Q182, Q185 are `_SUBTOTAL_TOTAL_PHP` auto-compute items. Must be computed (not entered) from their panel's `_PURCHASED_PHP + _INKIND_PHP` sum. | HARD: item is auto-set, enumerator cannot edit. PROC template in §4.9. |
| 10 | **Section M bill-recall chain** | Q140_RECALL_BREAKDOWN + Q141_BILL_ITEMS + Q141.1_NO_RECEIPT_AMT + Q142_RECALL_PAYMENT + Q143_HOW_PAID form a recall chain: if Q140 = No, skip Q141/Q141.1; if Q142 = No, skip Q143. Also Q129 gates whether Section M applies at all (only HHs with confinement experience answer bill-recall). | Spec as skip-logic §2 Section M + PROC §4.8. |
| 11 | **Section M gate item is Q129 (in Section L)** | The HH-confinement gate that decides whether ZBB/MAIFIP/Bill questions apply lives at Q129 inside Section L (not at the top of M). Straightforward cross-section routing but must be explicit. | Spec in §2 routing preamble. |
| 12 | **Q199 WTP open-ended amount** | Source captures "willingness-to-pay for consultation" as a PHP amount plus an "other" specify. | HARD: Q199 ≥ 0; `Q199_WTP_OTHER_TXT` required only when "Other" option ticked. |
| 13 | **Q202 worry reasons — select-all capacity** | Only 3 options in dcf (`O01`–`O03`) plus `_OTHER_TXT`. Verify source has only 3; if more, generator needs to expand. | Verify against source PDF; flag if mismatch. |

### B. Cosmetic / acceptable as-is

- Informed-consent metadata (witness name, address, tel) lives in `FIELD_CONTROL` via `build_field_control()` — parallel to F1/F3 treatment. No Section A dcf duplicate needed.
- Long select-all lists (Q65 20 options, Q74 10 options, Q82 8 options) render fine on tablets in CSEntry 8.0.
- Q11_EDUCATION, Q12_EMPLOYMENT use full verbatim DOH labels — intentional per the verbatim-labels rule.

---

## 2. Skip-logic table

### Routing preamble (whole-instrument)

- **Consent terminator.** `FIELD_CONTROL.CONSENT_GIVEN = No` at the top of the interview → terminate with `ENUM_RESULT_FIRST_VISIT = Withdraw Participation/Consent`. Entire questionnaire (A–Q) is suppressed.
- **Respondent-is-HH-head gate (Q1).** Q1 captures whether the respondent is the household head. Per source, if the respondent is not the HH head, some items may still be asked but flagged; no hard skip — handle as SOFT validation in §3.1.
- **HH-confinement gate (Q129, Section L).** Q129 = Yes → Section M (ZBB/MAIFIP/Bill) fully asked. Q129 = No → Section M items Q132–Q143 are skipped (ZBB/MAIFIP awareness still asked per printed form; bill-recall chain Q138–Q143 is the confinement-dependent part). See Section M table below for the precise split.
- **Roster expansion (Section C).** After B is complete, enumerator enters the roster loop for `count = Q19_HH_SIZE_TOTAL` members. Section J (Health-Seeking) also loops over the same roster per source — see sanity finding #2.

### Section A — Introduction and Informed Consent

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| — | `FIELD_CONTROL.CONSENT_GIVEN = No` | **Terminate interview** with `ENUM_RESULT_FIRST_VISIT = Withdraw Participation/Consent` |
| Q1 IS_HH_HEAD | = No | **Continue to Q2** (SOFT warn to enumerator: "Respondent is not the HH head — confirm they are a household decision-maker per sampling protocol") |

### Section B — Respondent Profile

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q4 LGBTQIA | — | No skip; captured for profile only |
| Q7 IS_PWD | = No | **Q11** (skip Q8–Q10 disability detail) |
| Q9 PWD_CARD | = No | **Q11** (skip Q10 — disability type only captured when card verified, same pattern as F3 Q14) |
| Q14 IP_MEMBER | = No | **Q16** (skip Q15 IP group specify) |
| Q22 ELECTRICITY | — | No skip; socio-economic class battery continues |
| Q23 WATER_SOURCE | Piped/faucet options | Q24 asked; other sources → **Q25** (skip Q24 faucet-share) |
| Q23 WATER_SOURCE | Dug well / tube well / spring options | Q25 asked; other sources → **Q26** (skip Q25 tube-share) |

### Section C — Household Roster (per-member loop; repeats for each of Q19 members)

> Roster is keyed by `MEMBER_LINE_NO = 1..Q19_HH_SIZE_TOTAL`. Rules below apply to each member iteration independently.

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q31 PRESENT | = No (not present at time of visit) | Per source, still capture Q32–Q50 from the HH head's knowledge; no skip |
| Q35 HAS_DISABILITY | = No | **Q39** (skip Q36 specify, Q37 card, Q38 type) |
| Q37 PWD_CARD | = No | **Q39** (skip Q38 disability-type — same as Section B) |
| Q41 EMPLOYMENT | Per source | No skip; GSIS/SSS/Pag-IBIG follow regardless |
| Q45 PHILHEALTH_REG | = Yes | **Q45.1** (when registered) → Q46 |
| Q45 PHILHEALTH_REG | = No | **Q45.2** (why not registered) → **Q48** (skip Q46 member-category, Q46 other-specify) |
| Q49 PRIVATE_INS | = No / No private insurance | **End of member-iteration** (skip Q50 other-specify) |

> [!note] Q45.1 / Q45.2 reinstated (DOH decision via Kidd 2026-06-09 — [[Source - PhilHealth Reinstatement Email (Kidd 2026-06-09)]])
> Two conditional sub-questions agreed with DOH (originally omitted after OAAED comments), reinstated after Q45 — wording identical to F3 Q38.1/Q38.2:
> - **Q45.1** *"When did you register and receive your PhilHealth PIN?"* — when **Q45 = Yes**.
> - **Q45.2** *"Why are you not registered with PhilHealth?"* — when **Q45 = No**.
>
> **✅ BUILT + DEPLOYED — UAT R5 (GH #794 Q45.1, #795 Q45.2), CSWeb HouseholdSurvey 2026-06-25.** As-built (confirmed in `HouseholdSurvey.dcf` 2026-06-29): Q45 lives in the **Section-C per-member household roster**; Q45.1/Q45.2 are wired **per member but answered by the main respondent only** (the resolved scope — ASPSI confirmed F4 on #795). Value sets:
> - **Q45.1 `Q45_1_PIN_REG_WHEN`** — select-one (numeric, len 1; restructured from the old YYYYMMDD date field): `1` Within the past year · `2` Within the last 2–3 years · `3` Within the last 4–5 years · `4` Over 5 years · `5` I don't know [DO NOT READ OUT LOUD] · `6` Refuse to answer [DO NOT READ OUT LOUD]. Asked only when Q45 = Yes.
> - **Q45.2 `Q45_2_WHY_NOT_REG`** — **single-select** (numeric, len 2): `01` Difficult to register · `02` Don't see value · `03` Don't know how · `04` Don't know what PhilHealth is · `05` A family member is registered · `06` Currently unemployed · `07` No time · `08` No valid ID · `88` Other (specify) → `Q45_2_WHY_NOT_REG_OTHER_TXT`. Asked only when Q45 = No.
> - Note: F4 Q45.2 is **single-select**; F3 Q38.2 (same question) is **tick-all** — optional ASPSI reconcile.

**Then Q47 (gate in `C_HH_PRIVATE_INS_GATE`)**: after roster loop completes, `Q47_HH_HAS_PRIVATE_INS` captured once at household level. If the roster already shows any member with Q49 = Yes, Q47 auto-computes to Yes (SOFT verify).

### Section D — UHC Awareness

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q51 UHC_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q54** (skip Q52 sources, Q53 understanding — entire Section D tail) |

### Section E — YAKAP/Konsulta Awareness

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q54 YAKAP_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q57** (skip Q55 sources, Q56 understanding) |

### Section F — BUCAS Awareness and Utilization

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q57 BUCAS_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q62** (skip Q58 sources, Q59 understanding, Q60 accessed, Q61 services) |
| Q60 BUCAS_ACCESSED | = No | **Q62** (skip Q61 services) |

### Section G — Access to Medicines

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q62 PURCHASE_FREQ | = Never (5) | **Q69** (skip Q63–Q68 — never purchases → skip Rx/conditions/where/travel/ease) |
| Q69 GAMOT_HEARD | = No | **Q75** (skip Q70–Q74 — never heard of GAMOT) |
| Q72 GAMOT_OBTAINED | = No | **Q75** (skip Q73 meds list, Q74 where-rest) |
| Q75 BRAND_GEN_KNOWS | = No | **Q79** (skip Q76–Q78 — exit Section G) |
| Q76 BRAND_OR_GEN | = Branded only | **Q78** (skip Q77 why-generic) |
| Q76 BRAND_OR_GEN | = Generic only | **Q79** (skip Q78 why-branded; after Q77) |
| Q76 BRAND_OR_GEN | = Don't know / Not applicable | **Q79** (exit Section G) |

### Section H — PhilHealth Registration and Health Insurance

> Section H applies when **THE RESPONDENT** (roster line 1) has `Q45_PHILHEALTH_REG = Yes`. Section H asks about the respondent's own PhilHealth-registration *experience* (paper Annex F4: "Answer Q79–Q88 if the respondent is registered in PhilHealth in Q45"), so if the RESPONDENT is not registered — even if other household members are — skip the entire Section H. (#649, 2026-06-20: corrected from the earlier "any member" reading, which contradicted the paper.)

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q79 REG_SOURCE | captured | No skip |
| Q81 REG_DIFFICULTY | = No / No difficulty | **Q83** (skip Q82 difficulty reasons) |
| Q83 KNOWS_ASSIST | = No | **Q85** (skip Q84 where-assist) |
| Q86 PREMIUM_PAY | = No (not a premium-paying member category) | **Q89** (skip Q87, Q88 — only premium payers answer pay-difficulty) |
| Q87 PREMIUM_DIFFICULT | = No | **Q89** (skip Q88 diff-paying reasons) |

### Section I — Primary Care

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q89 HAS_USUAL_FACILITY | = Yes | Q89.1 facility name captured, proceed to Q90 |
| Q89 HAS_USUAL_FACILITY | = No | **Q93** (skip Q89.1, Q90, Q91, Q92 — no usual facility → go straight to why-not reasons) |
| Q90 IS_USUAL_FOR_GENERAL | = Yes | **Q94** (skip Q91 why-went, Q92 facility type, Q93 why-not — they use usual facility for general care, proceed to transport) |
| Q90 IS_USUAL_FOR_GENERAL | = No | Q91, Q92 asked; Q93 skipped |
| Q97 KNOWS_BOOKING | = No | **Q100** (skip Q98, Q99 phone advice — doesn't know booking → phone questions moot) |

### Section J — Household members' Health-Seeking (loops per member; see sanity #2)

> Per source, Section J loops over the household roster. Until `J_HEALTH_SEEKING` is made repeating (schema gap #2), treat this section as single-respondent-scope and add a pilot-time note.

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q101 CHECKUP_FREQ | = Never / Don't know | **Q105** (skip Q102 visit reason, Q103 care type, Q104 preventive) |
| Q104 PREVENTIVE | — | No skip |
| Q105 FORGONE_CARE | = No / No forgone care | **End of member-iteration** (skip Q106 forgone-why, Q107 other-actions) |

### Section K — Referrals

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q108 REFERRED | = No | **Q126** (skip Q109–Q125 — jumps straight to Section L NBB) |
| Q112 VISITED | = Yes | **Q114** (skip Q113 why-not) |
| Q112 VISITED | = No, not planning **or** Not yet, planning | Q113 asked; after Q113 → **Q114** |
| Q117 SPECIALIST_FOLLOWUP | = No | **Q119** (skip Q118 sat-referral-process) |
| Q119 PCF_REFERRAL | = Yes | **Q120** PCP-knows, then Q122 discussed-places (skip Q121 why-hospital) |
| Q119 PCF_REFERRAL | = No | **Q121** (skip Q120 — not PCP referral → why-hospital asked) |
| Q124 PCP_WROTE_INFO | completed | **Q125** (close Section K) |

### Section L — NBB Awareness

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q126 NBB_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q129** (skip Q127 sources, Q128 understanding) |
| Q129 HH_CONFINED | = No | **Q144** (skip Q130, Q131 NBB utilization; skip Q132–Q143 bill-recall tail of Section M — proceed straight to Section N) |
| Q130 HOSPITAL_TYPE | = Public (per source) | Q131 NBB_OOP asked (NBB applies to public only per program design) |
| Q130 HOSPITAL_TYPE | = Private | **Q132** (skip Q131 — NBB doesn't apply to private) |

### Section M — ZBB / MAIFIP / Bill Recall

> Section M only runs when `Q129_HH_CONFINED = Yes`. The ZBB awareness sub-block (Q132–Q134) is asked regardless of confinement per source; bill-recall (Q138–Q143) is strictly confinement-dependent.

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q132 ZBB_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q136** (skip Q133 sources, Q134 understanding, Q135 ZBB-OOP) |
| Q135 ZBB_OOP | captured only if ZBB-eligible facility visited | Per source note — enumerator gate |
| Q136 MAIFIP_HEARD | = No / Don't know | **Q138** (skip Q137 sources) |
| Q138 MOST_EXPENSIVE | captured | No skip |
| Q140 RECALL_BREAKDOWN | = No | **Q142** (skip Q141 bill-items, Q141.1 no-receipt-amount) |
| Q141 BILL_ITEMS | select-all | No skip; Q141.1 conditional on presence of "no receipt" option |
| Q142 RECALL_PAYMENT | = No | **Q144** (skip Q143 how-paid — end of Section M) |

### Section N — Household Expenditures (WHO/SHA module)

> 42 consumption items, each with three-column pattern `_CONSUMED` → `_PURCHASED_PHP` → `_INKIND_PHP`. Four auto-computed subtotals (Q157 food, Q177 health 12-month, Q182 health 6-month, Q185 health 1-month).

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| `{Q}_CONSUMED` | = No | Next consumption item (skip `_PURCHASED_PHP`, `_INKIND_PHP` for this row) |
| Q157 FOOD_SUBTOTAL | — | Auto-compute; enumerator cannot enter |
| Q177/Q182/Q185 HEALTH_SUBTOTAL | — | Auto-compute |

### Section O — Sources of Funds for Health

> Q186–Q194 are yes/no per-source flags (9 sources). If HH had no health expenditure (Section N health totals = 0), Section O is technically moot but still asked for population-level coverage.

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q186–Q194 | each yes/no | No skip between sources |
| Q194 OTHER_SOURCE | = Yes | `Q194_OTHER_TXT` required |
| Q195 INCOME_PCT | captured as % | No skip |
| Q196 FOREGONE | select-all | No skip; `Q196_OTHER_TXT` if "Other" ticked |

### Section P — Financial Risk Protection

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q197 DELAYED_CARE | yes/no/N/A | No skip |
| Q198 NOT_FOLLOWED | yes/no/N/A | No skip |
| Q199 WTP_CONSULT | PHP amount | No skip; `Q199_WTP_OTHER_TXT` if "Other" option ticked |

### Section Q — Financial Anxiety

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q200 REDUCED_SPEND | yes/no | No skip |
| Q201 WORRIED | yes/no/sometimes | No skip |
| Q202 WORRY_REASONS | select-all | **End of questionnaire** — set `ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = Completed` |

---

## 3. Validations

HARD = block save; SOFT = warn-and-confirm; GATE = display-only (items rendered conditionally, don't validate when suppressed).

### 3.1 Field Control and Geographic ID

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `SURVEY_TEAM_LEADER_S_NAME`, `ENUMERATOR_S_NAME` | Required, non-blank | HARD |
| `DATE_FIRST_VISITED`, `DATE_FINAL_VISIT` | Required, valid date ≤ today | HARD |
| `DATE_FIRST_VISITED ≤ DATE_FINAL_VISIT` | Temporal ordering | HARD |
| `TOTAL_NUMBER_OF_VISITS` | `1 ≤ n ≤ 10` (warn if > 3) | HARD + SOFT |
| `ENUM_RESULT_FIRST_VISIT`, `ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT` | Required, ∈ value set | HARD |
| `CONSENT_GIVEN` | Required, ∈ {Yes, No}; if No → terminate | HARD |
| `HH_LISTING_NO` | Required, matches F3b listing form entry | HARD |
| `REGION` → `PROVINCE_HUC` → `CITY_MUNICIPALITY` → `BARANGAY` | PSGC cascade enforced at pick-time by `PSGC-Cascade.apc` — each child's `onfocus` filters its value set to children of the chosen parent, so an inconsistent pair is unrepresentable | HARD — cascade enforces |
| `HH_ADDRESS` | Required, non-blank | HARD |
| `CLASSIFICATION` | ∈ {Urban, Rural} — matches barangay classification from PSA | HARD |

### 3.1.1 GPS capture (household `HOUSEHOLD_GEO_ID` block)

Populated by `ReadGPSReading()` from `shared/Capture-Helpers.apc`; enumerator taps the capture-trigger item to fire the read. Unlike F1/F3, F4 preserves its baseline `LATITUDE`/`LONGITUDE` alpha items (no schema break for historical data) and the capture handler writes into them directly alongside the new GPS-metadata items.

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `CAPTURE_HH_GPS` | Trigger; auto-resets to blank after each successful read (so the button re-arms for retry) | — |
| `LATITUDE` | Alpha; after capture, `tonumber()` must be in `[4.5, 21.5]` (Philippine bounding box) | HARD |
| `LONGITUDE` | After capture, `tonumber()` in `[116.5, 127.0]` | HARD |
| `HH_GPS_ALTITUDE` | Alpha, metres; parsed for sanity when present | SOFT |
| `HH_GPS_ACCURACY` | Numeric, metres. Warn if `> 30` — re-read outdoors recommended | SOFT |
| `HH_GPS_SATELLITES` | Numeric. Warn if `< 4` (fix is below minimum for reliable lat/lon) | SOFT |
| `HH_GPS_READTIME` | Alpha UTC timestamp; must parse and be within `±24 h` of `DATE_FINAL_VISIT` | SOFT |
| `LATITUDE`/`LONGITUDE` non-blank required | When `ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = Completed*` | HARD |
| HH vs barangay centroid | Warn if captured point is `> 5 km` from the PSA-barangay centroid for the selected `BARANGAY` — likely wrong-barangay mis-capture (centroid lookup is a follow-on data task) | SOFT — advisory only |

### 3.1.2 Verification photo (`REC_CASE_VERIFICATION`)

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `CAPTURE_VERIFICATION_PHOTO` | Trigger; auto-resets after each successful capture | — |
| `VERIFICATION_PHOTO_FILENAME` | Non-blank when `ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = Completed*`; 120-char alpha populated by `TakeVerificationPhoto()` | HARD |
| Filename pattern | Matches `case-{QUESTIONNAIRE_NO}-verification.jpg` (enforced by the PROC that assigns it) | HARD |

### 3.2 Section A — Informed Consent

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `Q1_IS_HH_HEAD` | Required, ∈ {Yes, No}; if No → SOFT warn "Confirm respondent is HH decision-maker per protocol" | HARD + SOFT |

### 3.3 Section B — Respondent Profile

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `RESPONDENT_NAME` | Required, non-blank | HARD |
| `Q2_BIRTH_MONTH` | `1 ≤ m ≤ 12` | HARD |
| `Q2_BIRTH_YEAR` | `1900 ≤ y ≤ current_year` | HARD |
| `Q2_1_AGE` | `0 ≤ age ≤ 120` | HARD |

## 4. CSPro logic templates

Item names match `generate_dcf.py`. Paste into the corresponding `PROC` blocks in CSPro Designer. Shared helpers (`is_don_code`, select-all mutex, PSGC cascade) follow the same shapes as F3 `§4.1`–`§4.3`; repeated here only where F4 has a unique pattern.

### 4.1 Helper: global preproc

```cspro
PROC GLOBAL
numeric currentYYYYMMDD;
numeric currentYear;
numeric currentMonth;
numeric currentDay;
numeric rosterIdx;

PROC HOUSEHOLDSURVEY_DICT
preproc
  currentYYYYMMDD = sysdate();
  currentYear  = int(currentYYYYMMDD / 10000);
  currentMonth = int(mod(currentYYYYMMDD, 10000) / 100);
  currentDay   = mod(currentYYYYMMDD, 100);
```

### 4.2 Field Control + consent terminator

```cspro
PROC FIELD_CONTROL
postproc
  if CONSENT_GIVEN = 2 then           { 2 = No }
    ENUM_RESULT_FIRST_VISIT = 5;      { Withdraw Participation/Consent — confirm code }
    endgroup;                         { close interview; no data past here }
  endif;
```

### 4.3 PSGC cascade gate

Identical pattern to F3 §4.3 — PSGC is carried in `shared/psgc_*.dcf` external lookup dictionaries, and each child's `onfocus` calls into `shared/PSGC-Cascade.apc` to filter its value set to children of the chosen parent. Include the cascade .apc in the form's .app:

```cspro
#include "../shared/PSGC-Cascade.apc"
```

```cspro
PROC REGION
onfocus
  FillRegionValueSet(REGION);

PROC PROVINCE_HUC
onfocus
  FillProvinceValueSet(PROVINCE_HUC, REGION);

PROC CITY_MUNICIPALITY
onfocus
  FillCityValueSet(CITY_MUNICIPALITY, PROVINCE_HUC);

PROC BARANGAY
onfocus
  FillBarangayValueSet(BARANGAY, CITY_MUNICIPALITY);
```

F4 has only one PSGC block (the household address); no `P_` family is needed.

### 4.3a GPS capture and verification photo

Include `Capture-Helpers.apc` in the form's .app:

```cspro
#include "../shared/Capture-Helpers.apc"
```

```cspro
{ Household GPS — fired on the capture-trigger item. Writes into the preserved
  LATITUDE/LONGITUDE items plus the new HH_GPS_* metadata. }
PROC CAPTURE_HH_GPS
onfocus
  if ReadGPSReading(120, 20) then
    LATITUDE          = maketext("%f", gps(latitude));
    LONGITUDE         = maketext("%f", gps(longitude));
    HH_GPS_ALTITUDE   = maketext("%f", gps(altitude));
    HH_GPS_ACCURACY   = gps(accuracy);
    HH_GPS_SATELLITES = gps(satellites);
    HH_GPS_READTIME   = gps(readtime);
  endif;
  CAPTURE_HH_GPS = notappl;   { reset trigger so button re-arms }

PROC LATITUDE

### 4.12 Case-control preproc (SURVEY_CODE, DATE_STARTED, TIME_STARTED, AAPOR_DISPOSITION)

Added 2026-04-21 — same shape as F1 §4.17 and F3 §4.16. Five case-control items at the top of `FIELD_CONTROL`: `SURVEY_CODE` (literal "F4"), `INTERVIEWER_ID`, `DATE_STARTED`, `TIME_STARTED`, `AAPOR_DISPOSITION` (AAPOR 2023 value set).

```
PROC FIELD_CONTROL
preproc
  if visualvalue(SURVEY_CODE) = "" then
    SURVEY_CODE       = "F4";
    DATE_STARTED      = tonumber(sysdate("YYYYMMDD"));
    TIME_STARTED      = tonumber(systime("HHMMSS"));
    AAPOR_DISPOSITION = 0;                            { 000 = In Progress }
  endif;

PROC CONSENT_GIVEN
postproc
  if CONSENT_GIVEN = 2 then
    AAPOR_DISPOSITION = 210;              { Refusal — respondent }
    skip to AAPOR_DISPOSITION_FINAL;
  endif;
```

See F1 §4.17 for full notes on AAPOR codes and transition rules.

## 5. Open questions — routing

Disposition following the F3 pattern: genuine ASPSI asks vs spec-decisions.

### Needs ASPSI

1. **Q15 IP_GROUP coded list** — Source promises "A list will be provided" but Annex F4 ships only free-text (identical to F3 Q31). **Route to Juvy** alongside the F3 question — single ask covers both instruments. Default if no response: keep alpha.
2. **Section C roster repeating-record confirmation** — Current schema has C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER as flat; source describes it as "repeating keyed by member line number." **Route to ASPSI/DOH-PMSMD** if they want a specific max-occurrences cap (default proposal: 20) and whether the respondent is row 1 of the roster or tracked separately in Section B.
3. **Section J per-member looping confirmation** — Source says "loops over household members for health-seeking items." **Route to ASPSI** to confirm whether Section J asks per member or only the respondent. Default: honor source (per-member loop), pending response.

### Spec-decision (ASPSI may override)

4. **Q129 gates Section M bill-recall chain only, not ZBB/MAIFIP awareness** — Source prints ZBB awareness Q132–Q134 without an explicit gate; bill-recall Q138–Q143 is confinement-dependent by design. **Spec default**: ZBB/MAIFIP awareness asked regardless; bill chain gated on Q129 = Yes.
5. **Q135 ZBB_OOP enumerator gate** — Source note limits Q135 to patients who visited a ZBB-eligible facility. No dcf flag captures "facility eligibility." **Spec default**: enumerator leaves Q135 blank if not applicable; PROC accepts blank.
6. **Q130 hospital-type gate on Q131** — Source: NBB applies to public hospitals only. **Spec default**: if Q130 = Private, skip Q131. PROC coded in §4 (Section L).
7. **Q141.1 NO_RECEIPT_AMT cap** — Capping at Q139 total bill is a consistency guardrail; source doesn't specify. **Spec default**: HARD cap at `Q141_1 ≤ Q139`.
8. **Catastrophic-expenditure SOFT warn threshold (3×)** — 3× monthly income is a common CHE plausibility threshold (SDG 3.8.2 uses 10% and 25% of capacity-to-pay). **Spec default**: SOFT warn at 3× for enumerator verification; not a CHE measurement — computed separately in analysis.

---

## 6. Implementation order (recommended)

1. **Fix schema gaps #1 and #2 in `generate_dcf.py`** — make `C_HOUSEHOLD_ROSTER` and (per source) `J_HEALTH_SEEKING` repeating records with `MEMBER_LINE_NO` as id. This is the only regenerator blocker; once patched, the dcf goes from 618 to something higher (adds `occurrenceLabel` metadata; items unchanged). Re-run the generator, diff the dcf, verify items are unchanged and only record structure changed.
2. **Route ASPSI questions** (§5 items 1–3) in the same message — one batch, one reply expected. Default behaviors documented so the build isn't blocked pending response.
3. **Open `HouseholdSurvey.dcf` in CSPro Designer**, validate the dictionary loads cleanly; inspect record layout (11 data records + header + field control + geo + consent gate + roster + per-section blocks).
4. **Build the Form file** (`.fmf`) — one form per section A–Q + Field Control + Geographic ID; roster form gets its own scrolling behavior (per `CSPro CAPI Strategies`: roster scrolls alone). Tab-order aligned with Q-number sequence.
5. **Add PROC code** in this order:
   1. Field Control + consent terminator (§4.2) + PSGC cascade (§4.3) + GPS/photo capture (§4.3a)
   2. Section A–B consistency (§4.4) — age-birth-year, income bracket, HH-size sanity
   3. Roster loop (§4.5) — including post-loop count check and Q47 auto-set
   4. Awareness-block generics (§4.6) applied to D, E, F
   5. Section G generics (skip patterns match F3 Section K)
   6. Section H PhilHealth gating (§4 Section H) — depends on roster Q45
   7. Section I primary-care routing (§4.7)
   8. Section J per-member skips (§4 Section J) — depends on roster fix
   9. Section K referral tree (§4 Section K) — mirrors F3 Section L
   10. Section L NBB (§4 Section L) including Q129 hospital-type gate
   11. Section M bill-recall chain (§4.8) — confinement-gated
   12. Section N expenditure grid (§4.9) + subtotals
   13. Section O sources-of-funds + Q196 select-all
   14. Section P financial risk + Q199 WTP sanity
   15. Section Q anxiety + terminator (§4.11)
6. **Bench-test** with paper walk-through of 4 mock households: HH with confined member + PhilHealth coverage, HH with no PhilHealth and no confinement, HH with many members (test roster ≥ 5), HH where respondent is not HH head.
7. **Pretest readiness** — bundle as PFF for CSEntry Android distribution alongside F1/F3 when all three are Build-ready.
