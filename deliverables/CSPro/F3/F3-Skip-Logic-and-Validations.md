# F3 Patient Survey — Skip Logic and Validations Spec

Source-of-truth for CSPro CAPI logic on `PatientSurvey.dcf`. Covers:

1. **Sanity-check findings** — discrepancies between the Apr 20 questionnaire and the current dcf (18 records / 840 items).
2. **Skip-logic table** — every conditional jump extracted from the questionnaire.
3. **Cross-field validations** — HARD (block save), SOFT (warn-and-confirm), GATE (display-only conditional rendering).
4. **CSPro logic templates** — paste-ready snippets for common patterns (final chunk).

All Q-numbers refer to the **Apr 20 printed questionnaire** (1–178); dcf item names follow the `Q{n}_*` convention.

> **Item-count provenance.** The dcf was 387 items as of the Apr 08 baseline. The Apr 20 DOH-submitted questionnaire expanded from 126 printed items to 178, and the generator rebuild widened per-item data capture — payment-source matrices (Q92/Q94/Q96/Q98/Q107/Q109/Q112/Q113) exploded each payment row into `_PAY_{code}` flag + `_PAY_{code}_AMT` amount pairs, select-all items got per-option flag items, and `_OTHER_TXT` companions were added everywhere. That lifted the dcf to 15 records / 818 items on Apr 20. The Apr 21 GPS+photo capture pass added three further records — facility GPS (`REC_FACILITY_CAPTURE`, type Z), patient-home GPS (`REC_PATIENT_CAPTURE`, type Y), verification photo (type X) — plus a `PATIENT_GEO_ID` extra item and the `F3_FACILITY_ID` F1-linkage item, bringing the dcf to **18 records / 840 items**. See `wiki/analyses/Analysis - Apr 20 DCF Generator Audit.md` for the per-patch ledger.

## 1. Sanity-check findings (dcf vs Apr 20 questionnaire)

### A. Items to flag for generator fix before CAPI build

| # | Item | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Q14 DISABILITY_TYPE** — card-gated only | Source makes Q14 an enumerator-only item ("DO NOT READ ALOUD... record the type as indicated on the card"). Must only be answered when Q13 = "Yes (card was presented and verified)"; other Q13 answers should leave Q14 blank. | Spec as GATE rule in §3; no dcf change. |
| 2 | **Q18 amount + bracket duality** | Source captures both a free-entry numeric ("Approximate amount") AND the ticked bracket. The dcf stores both (`Q18_INCOME_AMOUNT`, `Q18_INCOME_BRACKET`) — correct — but needs a hard consistency check: amount must fall in bracket. | Spec as HARD consistency rule in §3. |
| 3 | **Q31 IP_GROUP specify** | Source says "A list will be provided to ensure accurate details" but none is included in Annex F3 — dcf currently uses a free-text alpha. Confirm with ASPSI whether a coded IP list will ship; if not, retain alpha. | Flag for ASPSI; keep alpha as default. |
| 4 | **Q147 / Q156 medication lists** | Both captured as single `alpha(length=240)`. If field reports indicate patients routinely list >240 chars of meds, consider converting to a roster record. Not a blocker for bench test. | Monitor during pilot. |
| 5 | **Q150 travel time HH/MM** | Dcf splits into `Q150_TRAVEL_HH` + `Q150_TRAVEL_MM` (both length=2). Needs a joint-sanity rule: MM ∈ [0, 59], and (HH=0 ∧ MM=0) is allowed only if patient lives at pharmacy — warn. | Spec as HARD range + SOFT sanity in §3. |
| 6 | **Q169 skip-branch coverage** | Source shows Q169 options 2 ("No, not planning") and 3 ("Not yet, planning") both skip to Q171; option 1 ("Yes") proceeds to Q170 then Q172. Q171 also has `<Proceed to Q172>` printed next to the stem — means Q171 is entered only from Q169 ∈ {2,3}, and after Q171 always jumps to Q172 regardless of Q170 having been skipped. | Spec as skip-logic in §3 under Section L. |
| 7 | **Q159 "Not applicable" → Q164** | Q159 option 5 "Not applicable" routes to Q164 — but Q164 lives in Section L (referrals) and Q159 is in Section K (medicines). That jumps out of a section. Verify with ASPSI this is intentional and not a typo for Q162. | Flag for ASPSI; default: honor source as printed. |
| 8 | **Q162 No → End of survey** | Hard terminator. Must set `ENUM_RESULT` to "Completed" (or "Completed at Hospital/Home" per Field Control codes) and prevent Sections L-tail from being entered. Handle in CSPro PROC. | Spec in §3 under Section L. |

### B. Cosmetic / acceptable as-is

- Informed-consent block (respondent name/signature, witness name, address, tel) lives in the shared `FIELD_CONTROL` record via `build_field_control()` — no Section-A dcf duplicate needed.
- Q45 member-category labels carry the full verbatim DOH definitions (paragraph-length) — intentional per the verbatim-labels rule; renders correctly in CSEntry.
- Q23 `Dug well` has no own/share sub-question (only piped/faucet paths do) — matches source.
- The dcf includes several long select-all lists (Q148 20 options, Q164 23 options) — these render fine on tablets in CSEntry 8.0.

### Section B — Patient Profile

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|

| Q12 PWD_SPECIFY | = No | **Q15** (skip Q13, Q14) |
| Q30 IP | = No | **Q32** (skip Q31) |
| Q33 DECISION_MAKER | = Yes (1) **or** "Companion is main DM" (3) | **Q35** (skip Q34) |

### Section C — UHC Awareness

| Child PSGC parent consistency | Enforced **at pick-time** by `PSGC-Cascade.apc` — `onfocus` on each child filters its value set to children of the chosen parent, so an inconsistent pair is unrepresentable (apply the same chain to the `P_*` family) | HARD — cascade enforces |

### 3.1.1 GPS capture blocks (`REC_FACILITY_CAPTURE` + `REC_PATIENT_CAPTURE`)

| `P_HOME_GPS_LATITUDE`, `P_HOME_GPS_LONGITUDE` | Same bounding-box checks as facility block | HARD |
| `P_HOME_GPS_ACCURACY`, `P_HOME_GPS_SATELLITES`, `P_HOME_GPS_READTIME` | Same sanity rules as facility block | SOFT |
| `P_HOME_GPS_*` non-blank required | When home-visit interview (`ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = Completed at Home`) or `PATIENT_TYPE = Outpatient` | HARD |
| Facility vs patient-home distance | Warn if `haversine(FACILITY_GPS_*, P_HOME_GPS_*) > 100 km` — likely cross-facility / mis-capture | SOFT |

### 3.1.2 Verification photo (type-X record)

| Item | Rule | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `CAPTURE_VERIFICATION_PHOTO` | Trigger; auto-resets to blank after each successful capture | — |
| `VERIFICATION_PHOTO_FILENAME` | Non-blank when `ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = Completed*`; 120-char alpha populated by `TakeVerificationPhoto()` | HARD |
| Filename pattern | Matches `case-{QUESTIONNAIRE_NO}-verification.jpg` (enforced by the PROC that assigns it) | HARD |
| File reachability | CSEntry attachment must sync to CSWeb before the case can be marked final; enforced by sync workflow, not dictionary validation | — |

| `PATIENT_TYPE` | Required, ∈ {Outpatient, Inpatient}; drives Section G vs Section H gating | HARD |
| `PATIENT_LISTING_NO` | Required, 4-digit zero-filled; must match a row in the F3b patient listing export | HARD |

## 2. Skip-logic table (Sections G–I)

**Routing preamble.** `FIELD_CONTROL.PATIENT_TYPE` is the authoritative routing signal:

- `PATIENT_TYPE = Outpatient` → enter Section G (Q88–Q104); skip Section H (Q105–Q115) entirely.
- `PATIENT_TYPE = Inpatient`  → skip Section G (Q88–Q104); enter Section H (Q105–Q115).
- Section I (Q116–Q130) is asked **for both** patient types after the applicable G or H has completed.

### Section G — Outpatient Care

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| — | `PATIENT_TYPE ≠ Outpatient` | **Section I** (skip entire G record) |
| Q89 ADVISED_ADMIT | = Yes | Q91 (Q90 is the "why not confined" reasons — only meaningful when Q89 = No; see §3.8 sanity rule) |
| Q93 LABS | "None" (17) ticked | **Q95** (skip Q94 lab-cost matrix) |
| Q95 PRESCRIBED | = No | **Q97** (skip Q96 meds-cost matrix) |
| Q99 BUCAS_HEARD | = No | **Q115 as printed** — source prints `<proceed to Q115>` which crosses out of Section G into Section H. See sanity finding #9; default behaviour: **skip to end of Section G** (i.e., skip Q100–Q104) |
| Q99 / Q100–Q103 enumerator gate | Respondent's area has no BUCAS center | Skip Q99–Q103 entirely (enumerator judgment per source note) |
| Q102 BUCAS_ACCESSED | = No | **Q104** (skip Q103) |

### Section H — Inpatient Care

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| — | `PATIENT_TYPE ≠ Inpatient` | **Section I** (skip entire H record) |
| Q108 MEDS_OUTSIDE | = No | **Q110** (skip Q109 meds-outside-cost matrix) |
| Q110 LAB_OUTSIDE | = No | **Q113** (skip Q111, Q112) |
| Q113 PhilHealth line (`Q113_PAY_08`) | = Yes (PhilHealth already availed) | **Q114.1** (skip Q114 — why-not-availed question moot) |

### Section I — Financial Risk Protection

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q116 NBB_HEARD | = No (2) **or** "I don't know" (3) | **Q119** (skip Q117, Q118) |
| Q119 ZBB_HEARD | = No (2) **or** "I don't know" (3) | **Q124** (skip Q120, Q121, Q122, Q123) |
| Q119 ZBB_HEARD | = Yes **and** `PATIENT_TYPE ≠ Inpatient` | **Q124** (Q122/Q123 presume a confinement context) |
| Q124 MAIFIP_HEARD | = No (2) **or** "I don't know" (3) | **Q130** (skip Q125–Q129) |
| — | `Q113_PAY_07` (Q113 MAIFIP row, inpatients only) = Yes | **Q125** still asked; **Q124 auto-set to Yes** per source note ("SKIP IF ANSWERED MAIFIP IN Q113" — interpreted as: don't re-ask awareness when they already availed it) |
| Q126 MAIFIP_AVAILED | = No | **Q129** (skip Q127, Q128) |
| Q127 MAIFIP_OOP | = No | **Q130** (skip Q128, Q129) |
| Q128 MAIFIP_OOP_ITEMS | (after completion) | **Q130** (skip Q129 — reached only via Q127 = Yes path) |

## 3. Validations (Sections G–I)

### 3.8 Sanity extensions (carries additional findings for chunks 3–4)

| # | Item | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | **Q99 No → Q115** | Source prints `<proceed to Q115>` but Q115 is in Section H; for an outpatient, Q115 is unreachable. Likely typo for "end of Section G". | Default: treat as end-of-Section-G (skip Q100–Q104). Flag to ASPSI for confirmation. |
| 10 | **Q90 asked regardless of Q89** | Source prints no skip between Q89 and Q90; but Q90 asks "reasons why you were NOT confined" — only meaningful when Q89 = No. | Soft-warn when `Q89_ADVISED_ADMIT = No` **and** Q90 has ticked options other than option 6 ("No need/regular check-up only"). |
| 11 | **Q99–Q103 BUCAS enumerator gate** | Source note: "Q99 to Q103 are applicable only to respondents in areas with BUCAS center. Otherwise, skip." No dcf field captures the enumerator judgment. | Add PROC-level `BUCAS_AREA_FLAG` (not in dcf) or rely on enumerator leaving Q99 blank. Simplest: if Q99 blank, treat Q100–Q103 as skipped. |
| 12 | **Q94 per-test cost matrix is aggregate** | Source says "To be asked for each lab test ticked in Q93"; dcf captures Q94 once in aggregate across all labs. | Acknowledged deviation — fieldable only if per-test roster is added. For Apr 20 bench test, aggregate is acceptable; flag for pilot. |
| 13 | **Q124 MAIFIP awareness implied by Q113** | Source note "SKIP IF ANSWERED MAIFIP IN Q113". If patient already availed MAIFIP (Q113_PAY_07 = Yes), re-asking "have you heard of MAIFIP" is redundant. | Auto-set `Q124_MAIFIP_HEARD = Yes` and hide Q124 when `Q113_PAY_07 = Yes`; proceed directly to Q125. |
| 14 | **Section H cost-matrix lengths** | Q107/Q109/Q112/Q113 amount fields use `length=9` (max 999,999,999 pesos). Inpatient stays with long confinement may approach this — monitor during pilot. | Monitor; no action. |

## 2. Skip-logic table (Sections J–L)

### Section J — Satisfaction on Amenities and Medical Care

No explicit skip rules in Section J. Q134 (Rooms) and Q135 (Overall time) are flagged "For inpatients only" in the printed form — see §3.12 gates.

### Section K — Access to Medicines

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q145 PURCHASE_FREQ | = "Never" (5) | **Q152** (skip Q146–Q151 — never purchases → skip meds-access block; proceed to GAMOT awareness) |
| Q152 GAMOT_HEARD  | = No | **Q158** (skip Q153–Q157 — never heard of GAMOT → skip sources/understanding/meds obtained/rest) |
| Q158 BRAND_GEN_KNOW | = No | **Q162** (skip Q159–Q161 — doesn't know difference → exit Section K) |
| Q159 BRAND_GEN_BOUGHT | = "Branded" (1) | **Q161** (skip Q160 — why-generic irrelevant) |
| Q159 BRAND_GEN_BOUGHT | = "Don't know the difference" (4) | **Q162** (skip Q160, Q161 — exit Section K) |
| Q159 BRAND_GEN_BOUGHT | = "Not applicable" (5) | **Q164** (source prints cross-section jump — see sanity finding #7; default: honor source) |

### Section L — Experiences and Satisfaction on Referrals

| Q | Condition | Skip to |
|---|---|---|
| Q162 REFERRED | = No | **End of survey** (skip Q163–Q178; set `ENUM_RESULT = Completed`) |
| Q169 VISITED | = "No, I'm not planning to" (2) **or** "Not yet, but I'm planning to" (3) | **Q171** (skip Q170 — didn't visit yet → no follow-up question) |
| Q170 FOLLOWUP | (after completion) | **Q172** (explicit — skip Q171) |
| Q171 WHY_NOT | (after completion) | **Q172** (explicit) |
| Q172 PCP_REFERRAL | = No | **Q177** (skip Q173–Q176 — not a PCP referral → skip PCP-role questions) |

## 4. CSPro logic templates

Drop these into the corresponding `PROC` blocks in CSPro Designer. Item names match `generate_dcf.py`.

### 4.1 Helper: global preproc

```cspro
PROC GLOBAL
numeric currentYYYYMMDD;
numeric currentYear;
numeric currentMonth;

PROC PATIENTSURVEY_FF          { application-level entry }
preproc
  currentYYYYMMDD = systemdate("YYYYMMDD");
  currentYear  = int(currentYYYYMMDD / 10000);
  currentMonth = int(currentYYYYMMDD / 100) % 100;
endpreproc
```

### 4.2 Field Control — consent terminator

```cspro
PROC CONSENT_GIVEN
postproc
  if CONSENT_GIVEN = 2 then  { No }
    ENUM_RESULT_FIRST_VISIT = 4;   { Withdraw Participation/Consent — code per Field Control value set }
    endgroup;                      { close the questionnaire }
  endif;
```

Latitude/longitude live in the GPS capture blocks (`REC_FACILITY_CAPTURE`, `REC_PATIENT_CAPTURE`) — see §4.3a below. Do not hand-enter these; the enumerator triggers a read via the capture buttons.

### 4.3 PSGC cascading dropdowns — external-lookup pattern

PSGC is carried in four external lookup dictionaries (`shared/psgc_region.dcf`, `psgc_province.dcf`, `psgc_city.dcf`, `psgc_barangay.dcf`) — **not** baked into the main dictionary. The cascade functions live in `shared/PSGC-Cascade.apc`; each child item fires its handler on `onfocus` so reverse navigation re-populates the list (CSPro 8.0 Users Guide p.188 Logic Tip #4). Include the cascade .apc in the form's .app:

```cspro
#include "../shared/PSGC-Cascade.apc"
```

```cspro
PROC REGION
onfocus
  FillRegionValueSet(REGION);

PROC PROVINCE_HUC
onfocus
  FillProvinceValueSet(PROVINCE_HUC, REGION);

PROC CITY_MUNICIPALITY
onfocus
  FillCityValueSet(CITY_MUNICIPALITY, PROVINCE_HUC);

PROC BARANGAY
onfocus
  FillBarangayValueSet(BARANGAY, CITY_MUNICIPALITY);

{ Mirror the same four handlers on P_REGION / P_PROVINCE_HUC / P_CITY_MUNICIPALITY / P_BARANGAY. }
PROC P_REGION
onfocus
  FillRegionValueSet(P_REGION);

PROC P_PROVINCE_HUC
onfocus
  FillProvinceValueSet(P_PROVINCE_HUC, P_REGION);

PROC P_CITY_MUNICIPALITY
onfocus
  FillCityValueSet(P_CITY_MUNICIPALITY, P_PROVINCE_HUC);

PROC P_BARANGAY
onfocus
  FillBarangayValueSet(P_BARANGAY, P_CITY_MUNICIPALITY);
```

### 4.3a GPS capture and verification photo

Include `Capture-Helpers.apc` in the form's .app:

```cspro
#include "../shared/Capture-Helpers.apc"
```

```cspro

    P_HOME_GPS_READTIME   = gps(readtime);
  endif;
  P_HOME_CAPTURE_GPS = notappl;

{ Post-capture sanity checks — run on the lat/lon items themselves, not on the trigger. }
PROC FACILITY_GPS_LATITUDE
postproc
  numeric lat;
  lat = tonumber(FACILITY_GPS_LATITUDE);
  if lat <> notappl and (lat < 4.5 or lat > 21.5) then
    errmsg("Facility latitude %f is outside the Philippine bounding box — re-capture.", lat);

PROC FACILITY_GPS_LONGITUDE
postproc

PROC VERIFICATION_PHOTO_FILENAME
postproc
  if ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT in 1,2,3 and length(strip(VERIFICATION_PHOTO_FILENAME)) = 0 then
    errmsg("Verification photo is required when the case is marked Completed.");
    move to CAPTURE_VERIFICATION_PHOTO;
  endif;

### 4.3b F1 linkage — `F3_FACILITY_ID`

```cspro
PROC F3_FACILITY_ID
postproc

  if loadcase(F1_FACILITY_DICT, F3_FACILITY_ID) = 0 then
    errmsg("F3_FACILITY_ID %s does not match any synced F1 facility — re-enter.", F3_FACILITY_ID);

  if F1_REGION <> REGION then
    errmsg("Linked facility is in region %d but this F3 case is in region %d.", F1_REGION, REGION);
    reenter;
  endif;

### 4.4 Core routing — PATIENT_TYPE drives G vs. H

```cspro

### 4.15 Section L — referral gate, Q169 branch, and terminator

```cspro

    ENUM_RESULT_FINAL_VISIT = 1;          { Completed — code per Field Control value set }
    endgroup;                             { close the questionnaire — skip Q163-Q178 }
  endif;

### 4.16 Case-control preproc (SURVEY_CODE, DATE_STARTED, TIME_STARTED, AAPOR_DISPOSITION)

Added 2026-04-21 — same shape as F1 §4.17 and F4 §4.X. Five case-control items at the top of `FIELD_CONTROL`: `SURVEY_CODE` (literal "F3"), `INTERVIEWER_ID`, `DATE_STARTED`, `TIME_STARTED`, `AAPOR_DISPOSITION` (AAPOR 2023 value set).

```
PROC FIELD_CONTROL
preproc
  if visualvalue(SURVEY_CODE) = "" then
    SURVEY_CODE       = "F3";
    DATE_STARTED      = tonumber(sysdate("YYYYMMDD"));
    TIME_STARTED      = tonumber(systime("HHMMSS"));
    AAPOR_DISPOSITION = 0;                            { 000 = In Progress }
  endif;

PROC CONSENT_GIVEN
postproc
  if CONSENT_GIVEN = 2 then
    AAPOR_DISPOSITION = 210;              { Refusal — respondent }
    skip to AAPOR_DISPOSITION_FINAL;
  endif;
```

See F1 §4.17 for full notes on AAPOR codes and transition rules.

## 5. Open questions — routing

Disposition of the six items previously held "open." Only **#1 (Q31 IP_GROUP)** genuinely requires ASPSI input; the rest are spec-level decisions documented below, with ASPSI override reserved if they disagree.

### Needs ASPSI

1. **Q31 IP_GROUP list** — Source promises "a list will be provided" but Annex F3 ships only free-text. **Route to Juvy** before bench test: either (a) ASPSI ships a coded IP value set, or (b) we keep alpha as final. Default if no response: keep alpha.

### Spec-decision (ASPSI may override)

2. **Q99 No → Q115 cross-section skip** (sanity #9) — Source prints a jump from Section G (outpatient) into Section H (inpatient); mid-H is unreachable for an outpatient. **Spec default**: treat as end-of-Section-G (skip Q100–Q104). PROC coded accordingly (§4). Flag to DOH-PMSMD only if they surface it.
3. **Q159 "Not applicable" → Q164 cross-section jump** (sanity #7) — Source prints a jump from Section K (medicines) into Section L (referrals). **Spec default**: honor source as printed. PROC coded in §4.14. Flag to DOH-PMSMD only if they surface it.
4. **Q94 per-test cost capture** (sanity #12) — Source specifies per-test capture; dcf aggregates. **Spec default**: aggregate for Apr 20 bench test; roster conversion revisited at pilot.
5. **Q99–Q103 BUCAS enumerator gate** (sanity #11) — Source note: "applicable only to respondents in areas with BUCAS center; otherwise skip." No dcf flag. **Spec default**: enumerator leaves Q99 blank → Q100–Q103 auto-skipped; no dedicated `BUCAS_AREA_FLAG` item added.
6. **Q124 auto-set from Q113 MAIFIP** (sanity #13) — Source note "SKIP IF ANSWERED MAIFIP IN Q113." **Spec default**: if `Q113_PAY_07 = Yes`, auto-set `Q124_MAIFIP_HEARD = Yes` and hide Q124, proceed to Q125. PROC coded in §4.13.

## 6. Implementation order (recommended)

1. **Fix dcf items flagged in §1** — none are regenerator blockers; current build (18 records / 840 items) is bench-testable.
2. **Open `PatientSurvey.dcf` in CSPro Designer**, validate the dictionary loads cleanly; inspect record layout (14 data records + header).
3. **Build the Form file** (`.fmf`) — one form per section A–L + Field Control + Geographic ID; tab-order aligned with Q-number sequence.
4. **Add PROC code** in this order:
   1. Field Control consent terminator (§4.2) + PSGC cascade (§4.3) + GPS/photo capture (§4.3a) + F1 linkage (§4.3b)
   2. Routing gate at Section F (§4.4)
   3. Section A eligibility (§4.5) + Section B consistency (§4.6, §4.7)
   4. Select-all/Other enforcement generics (§4.8, §4.9)
   5. Payment-source matrix pattern (§4.10) applied across Q92/Q94/Q96/Q98/Q107/Q109/Q112/Q113
   6. Section-specific skips (§4.11–§4.15)
5. **Bench-test** with paper walk-through of 4 mock respondents: outpatient with PhilHealth + YAKAP, outpatient non-member, inpatient with MAIFIP, referral-non-planner.
6. **Pretest readiness** — bundle as PFF for CSEntry Android distribution alongside the F3b patient listing import.

*This spec is generated from the Apr 20 2026 Annex F3 PDF and the Apr 21 dcf (18 records / 840 items, post-GPS/photo + F1-linkage). Update both this file and `generate_dcf.py` whenever the questionnaire is revised.*
